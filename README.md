 GUIDANCE:
 
To play, download the entire repository and run the alien_invasion.py file and you must have python installed on your machine and probably other pending issues that the interpreter will notify you of

You will have three additional ships to survive, at the top center of the screen is the match points record and at the top right is your current score.

With each horde of ships the game gets faster, consequently more difficult.

You can make three shots in a row, but at the pace of the game you are unlikely to feel unlimited.
